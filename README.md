## How to use "Market" :
* you can find your item with command item.find(), for example Milk.find(). If there are Milk, program will say where you can find it
* Milk.getWeight() will show weight of Milk
* Milk.getPrice() will show price of Milk
* Milk.buyItem() will ask you about money and if you pay - show bill

* * *

## Add new product: 

Also you can add new items in market with command: var itemName = new Item(name, weight, price, place).
 
For example: var Salt = new Item('Salt', 2, 10.5, '1st room')
 
Market has 3 rooms, so you can write only:
* 1st room
* 2nd room
* 3rd room
